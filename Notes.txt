Some Tips:
Check file and folder permissions for user intended for to make sure it works!
This includes .txt files and .sh files!

Also open ports (forwarding ports) and firewalls if required for port 776 and 777
and for remote shell the port is 1234, all these can be changed!

Copy and paste the generated key with ctrl shift c and ctrl shift and v buttons

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Check all files permissions to make sure text files and folders are writable by desired user(s).

* Some Features like repair Corrupted Message Is Experimental!

* Using upload file function works with relative paths so the folder containing the app is where to put files to be uploaded and inside the file sender the filename of file in that folder, the files will be encrypted with the key you give, the encrypted file lives in uploads folder and will be replaced when a new file gets sent, on the other end the recieving side will store downloaded files in the downloads folder.
