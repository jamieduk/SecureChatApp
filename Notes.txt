Some Tips:
Check file and folder permissions for user intended for to make sure it works!
This includes .txt files and .sh files!

Also open ports (forwarding ports) and firewalls if required for port 776 and 777
and for remote shell the port is 1234, all these can be changed!

Check all files permissions to make sure text files and folders are writable by desired user(s).
